# Privacy Policy

This extension operates entirely on your device. It does not collect, transmit, sell, or share any personal or sensitive user data.

- No analytics or telemetry
- No network requests to third‑party servers
- Uses browser storage (chrome.storage.local) to remember simple UI state like whether Auto Read/Auto Next were enabled

If you publish this extension, include a link to this policy in your store listing and describe why permissions are needed:
- activeTab, scripting: inject the reader into the current page after user action
- storage: remember your toggles
