# Short Recording Script (30–45s)

Goal: Capture a clean demo video for the store and README.

## Setup
- Load the extension in Chrome: chrome://extensions → Developer mode → Load unpacked → select the extension folder.
- Toggle “Allow access to file URLs” for this extension (so it can run on local demo pages).
- Open `store-assets/demo/demo1.html` in Chrome (right‑click → Copy path, paste into the address bar with `file:///` prefix).
- In the extension popup, ensure Auto Next is ON and rate ~0.9–1.0.

Tip: If file URLs are restricted, serve the demo folder with any local server and use http://localhost/ instead.

## Shot list
1) Show the demo page briefly (title “Demo Chapter 1”).
2) Click the extension icon to open the popup.
3) Click Start. Status updates to “Reading started…”.
4) Adjust Rate slider slightly to show controls.

7) On Chapter 2, open the popup once more for a closing shot.
