    <p>Long before sunrise, the city stirred. Streetlights hummed; shutters sighed. A kettle clicked somewhere, and the day, still fragile, unfolded like a page. You liked to listen when it was quiet—when paragraphs were easy to follow and the next chapter felt near.</p>
    <p>Today, our reader will speak this page aloud. You can adjust the rate and pitch in the popup, enable Auto Next, and skip forward if needed. When the final word lands, the extension will look for a next chapter and move there, hands‑free.</p>
    <p>Readers of every language are welcome. If the page declares a language, the voice will try to match. Everything happens locally, without sending the text away. That’s the point: a peaceful reading experience that simply speaks.</p>
    <p>As the lines continue, imagine your audience listening—walking, cooking, or resting—while chapters advance automatically. This demo keeps things straightforward so the recording is clear.</p>
    <p>When the narration finishes, watch for the transition to Chapter 2 below. You can also press <strong>Ctrl + `</strong> to pause or resume during the recording.</p>
