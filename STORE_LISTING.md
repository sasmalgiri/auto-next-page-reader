Title
Auto Next Page Reader

Item summary (≤132 chars)
Read pages aloud and auto‑open the next chapter. Start/Stop/Skip, auto‑language, and TTS rate/pitch controls. Works offline.

Item description
Auto Next Page Reader speaks the main content of any page using your browser’s built‑in Text‑to‑Speech. When the page finishes, it can automatically open the next page/chapter on reading sites—so you can keep listening hands‑free.

Why you’ll like it
- Readability‑powered text extraction for clear, clutter‑free narration
- Start / Stop / Skip forward controls in a compact popup
- Auto‑Next via next button, URL chapter numbers, rel=next, or link text
- Auto‑detects language; picks a suitable voice when available
- Adjustable speech rate and pitch; quick keyboard resume (Ctrl + `)
- Private by design: runs locally, no analytics or data sharing
 - NEW: Optional Auto‑scroll while reading to trigger lazy/infinite content on long chapters

How it works
- On‑demand: when you click Start, the extension extracts readable text and speaks it.
- Auto‑Next: after finishing, it looks for next‑page patterns and opens the next chapter when found.
 - Dynamic pages: if a site loads text on scroll, Auto‑scroll (optional) helps fetch content while you listen.

Permissions (minimal)
- activeTab, scripting — inject the reader only into the tab you act on
- storage — remember your preferences (Auto Read/Next, rate/pitch, language)

Privacy
- No telemetry or user tracking; no data leaves your device
