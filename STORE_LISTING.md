Title: Auto Next Page Reader

Short description (max ~80 chars):
Read pages aloud and auto‑open the next chapter. Works offline.

Full description:
Next Chapter Reader extracts the main content from web pages and reads it aloud using your browser’s built‑in Text‑to‑Speech. When a chapter finishes, it can automatically open the next one.

Highlights
- Readability‑powered content extraction
- Auto‑Next to the following chapter (button → URL pattern → rel=next → next‑link text)
- Works entirely offline; no data leaves your device
- Adjustable rate and pitch; auto‑detects language/voice
- Keyboard: Ctrl + ` to pause/resume

How it works
- The extension runs on the current page to extract readable text and send it to Text‑to‑Speech.
- Auto‑Next looks for site “next” buttons, common chapter URL patterns, and standard "rel=next" links.

Permissions rationale
- activeTab, scripting: Inject the reading logic into the current page when you use the extension
- storage: Remember your settings (Auto Read/Next, rate, pitch, language choice)

Privacy
- No analytics or telemetry
- No network calls to third‑party servers
- All processing happens locally in your browser
- See the included PRIVACY.md for details

Credits
- Includes Readability.js (Apache 2.0). See THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md
